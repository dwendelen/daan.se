= Domain

== DNS
Is registered and managed at https://nameisp.com

Is configured to check the nameservers of https://dynv6.com

== Dynamic DNS
Is done by https://dynv6.com and is free

We only use AAAA records (IPv6)

See `/dynv6` for client to automatically update the DNS record

== Certificate
Wanted to use letsencrypt which is free and automated
but it did not work

Now certificate from https://comodosslstore.com/ (Product = Positive SSL).

=== Renew
- Use HTTPS validation
- Put the file in /var/www/.well-known/...
- Add ipv4 address in dynv6
- Setup correct port forward

=== Register certificates
Add two files (pem format) in `certificate`

- `daan.se.crt`
- `daan.se.key`
